## What you can expect
* Bytez will replace Adobe Reader when you open ML / data science papers from Arxiv.org
* At the moment, only Chromium browsers are supported
* If you open an ML paper that we havent seen yet, it may take us a few seconds to crawl the web for its content and convert it to HTML. Thereafter, that paper should load in less than 1 second. :)
* Please provide us feedback. We'll turn your ideas into features for the world to experience
